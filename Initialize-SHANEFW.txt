Firewall:

Web Interface for pfSense Firewall
http://10.0.0.1/

1. Connect Hyper-V External Switch
2. Connect Hyper-V Internal Switch
3. Assign interfaces hn0 and hn1 to either LAN / WAN according to MAC Address
4. WAN Interface - External Switch: DHCP
5. LAN Interface - Internal Switch: Static - IP: 10.0.0.1 - Subnet: 24
6. On VMs configure Default Gateway as 10.0.0.1
7. Open web interface at http://10.0.0.1
8. Hostname: SHANEFW
9. Domain: AD.SMHCOMPUTERS.COM
10. Primary DNS Server: 8.8.8.8 (Google Public DNS) 
11. Check "Allow DNS server list to be overridden by DHCP/PPP on WAN"
12. Time Server Hostname: time.nist.gov
13. Timezone: US/Central
14. Under 'WAN Configuration'
15. Uncheck "Block private networks from entering via WAN"
16. Uncheck "Block non-Internet routed networks from entering via WAN"
17. Verify static IP on LAN interface is set to 10.0.0.1
18. Set Admin password
19. Reload 
20. Under 'System' -> 'General Setup'
21. DNS Resolution Behavior: "Use local DNS (127.0.0.1), fall back to remote DNS Servers (Default)"
22. Under 'System' -> 'Advanced' -> 'Admin Access'
23. Check "HTTPS (SSL/TLS)"
24. Check "Enable Secure Shell"
25. SSHd key Only: "Password or Public Key"
26. Check "Allow Agent Forwarding"
27. SSH port: 22
28. Under 'Services' -> 'DHCP Server'

Interfaces:
WAN = DHCP
LAN = 10.0.0.1 (Gateway for VMs)


Interface Rule Directions:
Ingress = Incoming Traffic
Egress = Outgoing Traffic
Always configure Inbound (Ingress) Rules on WAN Interface
Always configure Outbound Rules (Egress) Rules on LAN Interface
OpenVPN <- Inbound (Ingress) Rules 



Default Firewall Rule:
Implicit Deny (If interface has no rules - all traffic will be blocked)

Firewall Priorities:
Rules with the most privileges are at the top

Rules Priorities:
System Rules
Floating Rules 
Interface Rules

Always configure anti-lockout rule as first rule
Creating port forwarding creates firewall rules automatically

Structure of Firewall Rules:
Action: Pass/Block/Reject
Interface: LAN/WAN
Protocol: Protocol
Source: Source of Network Traffic
Destination: Destination of Network Traffic

Rules:
	1. Remove LAN interface Rule 'Default allow LAN to any rule'
	2. Remove LAN interface Rule 'Default allow LAN IPv6 to any rule'
	3. Add LAN interface Rule to Allow Egress ICMP traffic - To permit pinging 
	4. Add LAN interface Rule to Allow Egress SSH traffic - To permit SSH traffic 
	5. Add LAN interface Rule to Allow Egress DNS traffic - To permit name resolution
	6. Add LAN interface Rule to Allow Egress HTTP traffic - To permit egress HTTP traffic
	7. Add LAN interface Rule to Allow Egress HTTPS traffic - To permit egress HTTPS traffic
	8. Add LAN interface Rule to Allow Egress DNS over TLS traffic - To permit name resolution
